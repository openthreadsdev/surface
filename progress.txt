F005 - Engineering Baseline: Hooks + CI + Security Scanning [PASSES]
- TypeScript + Vite build pipeline for Chrome MV3 extension
- ESLint (flat config) + Prettier with pre-commit hook (format, lint, typecheck)
- Pre-push hook runs unit tests
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, typecheck, test, build, package artifact
- CodeQL security scanning (PR + weekly schedule)
- Release workflow with signed/hashed artifacts on tag push
- Vitest with v8 coverage at 50% threshold floor
- Extension scaffold: manifest.json, popup, content script, background service worker
- Data-driven rule definitions: field-groups.ts, claim-keywords.ts
- Core types: ScanResult, FieldResult, ClaimFlag, ProductCategory
- 13 passing unit tests across 3 test files
